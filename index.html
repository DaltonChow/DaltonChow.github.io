    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hello World! My name is Dalton Chow and I'm an upcoming and aspiring Front-End Web Developer looking to get a full-time job related to the field. I attended California
      State University, Los Angeles for 6 years and studied Kinesiology. Recently, I decided to pick up programming primarily as a hobby to do in the summer; however, after 
      taking lessons on Codeacademy, W3Schools, and Udemy, I found myself deeply immersed and passionate about the subject that I went ahead and decided to create a simple 
      portfolio website. Programming is my biggest hobby right now and I spend about 4-6 hours everyday diving in to the subject. I hope to turn this new hobby of mines into
      a profession in the near future as I become more proficient with it.<br>
    Other hobbies besides coding that I enjoy doing in my spare time are:
      <li>
        <ul>Exercising</ul>
        <ul>Cooking</ul>
        <ul>Playing video games</ul>
        <ul>Watching programming videos</ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      If you have any questions or would like to know more about me, please feel free to contact me at dalton.dc.chow@gmail.com!
